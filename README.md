# ProteinCLIP Query Widget

A simple web interface and python notebook widget to query ProteinCLIP with text.

All credit for ProteinCLIP goes to the authors https://github.com/wukevin/proteinclip. Please cite them https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.14.594226v1. I reused code from their repository and directly used their models.

I directly use their ProteinCLIP models as you can see in [`pretrained/`](./pretrained/).
