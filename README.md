# DS569k-viewer

Similar protein search interface for the [DS569k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/donnyb/569k-protein-embeddings) dataset.

## Credit

All credit for the data goes to https://www.uniprot.org/ and https://www.expasy.org/resources/uniprotkb-swiss-prot and to the original authors of each protein. I directly took the data from them.

Large pieces of code were copied from https://github.com/wukevin/proteinclip to embed both ESM and ProteinCLIP. Without their pretrained models and code, I could not have produced the embeddings.

And credit to Fair ESM for the pretrained ESM2 models https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm.
